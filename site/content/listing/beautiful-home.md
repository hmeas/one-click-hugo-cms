Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. No. Uh, yeah.



Oh hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doing? What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. It's about the future, isn't it? Really. Yeah.



Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance? Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. My pine, why you. You space bastard, you killed a pine. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?
